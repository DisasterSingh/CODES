#Given two arrays A and B of equal size N, the task is to find if given arrays are equal or not. 
#Two arrays are said to be equal if both of them contain same set of elements, arrangements (or permutation) of 
#elements may be different though.
#Note : If there are repetitions, then counts of repeated elements must also be same for two array to be equal.

#Input:
#The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
#Each test case contains 3 lines of input. The first line contains an integer N denoting the size of the array. 
#The second line contains element of array A[]. The third line contains elements of the array B[].
