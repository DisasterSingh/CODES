#Given a string str consisting of lowercase and uppercase characters, 
#the task is to find the minimum possible length the string can be reduced to after
#performing the given operation any number of times.
#In a single operation, any two consecutive characters can be removed 
#if they represent the same character in different cases 
#i.e. “aA” and “Cc” can be removed but “cc” and “EE” cannot be removed.
