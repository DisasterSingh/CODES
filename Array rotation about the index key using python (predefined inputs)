Program for array rotation


def test14(arr,key):
    mainarr = []
    for i in range(0,len(arr)):
        for j in range(key+1,len(arr)):
            mainarr.append(arr[j])
        for k in range(0,key+1):
            mainarr.append(arr[k])
        break
    print(mainarr)
    
    
arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
key = 3
test14(arr,key)

#this code has taken predefined inputs .
#taken a key , by which the index is represented and the mainarr is filled with the output as per the program 
#easiest method to remember the array rotation.
